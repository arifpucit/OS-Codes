Welcome to the **Operating Systems Course** repository! This collection contains C program source codes for all sample programs and Proof of Concepts (PoCs) discussed during our undergraduate-level Operating Systems lectures.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for students enrolled in the Operating Systems course. Each program demonstrates fundamental OS concepts through practical C implementations, making complex theoretical concepts tangible and understandable.

### 🔗 Course Resources
- **Lecture Slides**: [http://arifbutt.me/cources](http://arifbutt.me/cources)
- **Course Level**: Undergraduate
- **Programming Language**: C

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler or any C compiler
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Linux/Unix environment (recommended)

### How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the specific program directory
3. Compile using `gcc program_name.c -o program_name`
4. Execute the compiled program

## 📖 Learning Approach

> **Important Note**: While these source codes are provided to save your typing efforts, I **strongly recommend** that you:
> 
> - ✅ Type the programs yourself for better understanding
> - ✅ Compile and execute them independently
> - ✅ Make modifications and experiment with the code
> - ✅ Do "Scuba Diving" into the underlying concepts

### 🎯 Learning Philosophy
*"The best way to learn programming is by programming!"* 

Don't just copy-paste the code. Engage with it, modify it, break it, and fix it. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of operating system concepts.
