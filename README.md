Dear Students, this repository contains the C program source codes of all the sample programs (PoCs) discussed in the lectures of the course "Operating Systems", taught at the undergraduate level with lecture slides hosted at http://arifbutt.me/cources
This may save your typing efforts but I strongly recommend to type the programs and do all the compilations yourself for better understanding. Do make changes in the programs and execute them to do Scuba Diving in the underlying concepts.

Wish you all the best
Happy Coding
Arif Butt
